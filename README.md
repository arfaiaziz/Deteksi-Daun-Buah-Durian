# 🌿 Durian Leaf Classification using CNN

![Durian](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/durian.png)  
A Computer Vision project to classify **durian leaf varieties** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
This system aims to assist farmers and agribusiness practitioners in **verifying the authenticity of durian seedlings** by analyzing leaf images.

## 📖 Background

Durian is a high-value tropical fruit widely cultivated in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia. Due to the **high demand** and **long growing period**, many farmers fall victim to **fraudulent seedling sales**. One of the key reasons is the **visual similarity of leaves** among different durian varieties, which makes them difficult to distinguish with the naked eye.

To solve this issue, this project utilizes **Computer Vision with CNN** to develop a system that classifies durian leaves from four popular varieties:

- Duri Hitam
- Musang King
- Super Tembaga
- Bawor

By using this system, users can **take a photo of a leaf** and instantly verify the varietal identity, reducing fraud risk and supporting smart agriculture.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a CNN-based image classification model for durian leaf identification.
- Build a prototype application that works with phone or digital camera images.
- Provide a fast and accurate tool to assist farmers in verifying seedling authenticity.
- Support agricultural research and modern visual technology in farming.

---

## 🌟 Benefits

- Helps **farmers** avoid fraud in durian seedling purchases.
- Supports **researchers** in fast and accurate varietal identification.
- Encourages the adoption of **AI-powered tools** in agriculture.
- Reduces economic losses and enhances long-term agricultural planning.

## ✅ Results & Conclusion

This project demonstrates that CNNs can effectively distinguish between visually similar leaf types of durian varieties. The system can:

- Identify Duri Hitam, Musang King, Super Tembaga, and Bawor
- Reduce misidentification risks
- Be expanded into a mobile app for broader adoption

It lays the foundation for **future smart farming tools**, combining deep learning with agriculture to promote accuracy, trust, and data-driven decision-making.
